The instructions provided in this guide are derived from [https://www.linuxtechi.com/install-vmware-workstation-on-ubuntu/](https://www.linuxtechi.com/install-vmware-workstation-on-ubuntu/). Additionally, the process of building VMware host modules (Player and Workstation) to be compatible with newer kernels has been included using the source code available at [https://github.com/mkubecek/vmware-host-modules](https://github.com/mkubecek/vmware-host-modules). It is necessary to build and reinstall VMware host modules whenever there is an update to the Linux Kernel.

Download VMware Workstation PRO  
To install VMware Workstation on Ubuntu 22.04, visit the Official [VMWare download Page](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-pro/workstation-pro-evaluation.html) and download the installation bundle as indicated below.

wget https://download3.vmware.com/software/WKST-1702-LX/VMware-Workstation-Full-17.0.2-21581411.x86_64.bundle
```

Install VMware Workstation  
Before starting the installation, letâ€™s first install the prerequisites using beneath apt command,

```text-plain
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y build-essential libxi6 libgconf-2-4 libxinerama1 libxcursor1 libxtst6 gcc make
```

To install VMware Workstation, run the following bash command. Kindly note that the VMware Workstation installation file name will be different from yours if a newer version will be made available.

```text-plain
sudo bash VMware-Workstation-Full-17.0.2-21581411.x86_64.bundle
```

The command extracts the VMware installer and installs VMware on your system. This takes roughly 5 minutes, so just be patient. At the very end, you will get confirmation that the installation was successful.
